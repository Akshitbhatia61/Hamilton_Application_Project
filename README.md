Hamilton Application Project

Dataset Used: - 

The data for this chart is sourced from a file named "Development_Applications.csv"

About Dataset: -
•	The dataset contains a total of 3,550 records, and each record is described using nine unique fields or attributes. 
•	Columns: X, Y: Coordinates (probably in a specific projection system). OBJECTID: A unique identifier for each entry. 
•	FILE_NUM: File number associated with the application.
•	 FILE_TYPE: The type of file/application (e.g., Subdivision, Part Lot Control).
•	ADDRESS: The physical address related to the application. FILE_YEAR: The year the file was recorded. 
•	DESCRIPTION: A brief description of the application. 
•	APPLICATION_ID: An identifier for the application (seems to be missing in this dataset).



 
Report 1 Development Application by Year

 

•	The chart displays a comparison of application numbers across various years. The horizontal axis indicates the total number of applications. 
•	The vertical axis lists years, arranged in descending order from the most recent at the top to the earliest at the bottom. 
•	The length of each bar on the chart corresponds to the number of applications filed in that year. 
•	The year with the highest number of applications is marked by the longest bar, whereas the shortest bar indicates the year with the fewest applications. 
•	While specific numbers aren't visible in this view, Tableau typically enables users to hover over bars for detailed information. 
•	The chart might have filters applied, as suggested by a "Filters" section, though the exact nature of these filters isn't clear from the provided information. 
•	The data for this chart is sourced from a file named "Development_Applications.csv." Fields included in the dataset are Address, Application Id, Description, File Num, File Type, File Year, Objectid, X, and Y.

Report 2 Development Application by Year and Type

 

•	The chart represents data spanning six years, from 2016 to 2021, which is indicated on the X-axis. 
•	The Y-axis quantifies the total number of development applications filed each year.
•	Each bar in the chart corresponds to a specific type of development application, such as Zoning Amendment, Subdivision, or Site Plan. The height of each bar reflects the volume of applications for that category each year. 
•	The bars are color-coded, making it easy to distinguish between different types of development applications.
•	 Certain bars are labeled "Average, " suggesting these represent the average number of applications for that type across the years included in the dataset. 
•	The data for this chart comes from a file named "Development_Applications.csv, " which likely contains detailed fields like address, application ID, and description. 
•	There is an average line that tells the average for each section. 
•	A legend on the right side of the chart categorizes the various types of development applications, helping viewers understand and interpret the data.



 
Conclusion

To wrap it up, the data we've looked at paints a detailed picture of the development landscape over a period of six years. By breaking down the numbers of building applications by type and year, we get a clear sense of how the community's needs and priorities have evolved. The colorful graphs make it easy to spot which types of developments were hot each year and which cooled down, giving city planners, developers, and the community a bird's-eye view of the growth trends. This isn't just a bunch of numbers and charts; it's a story of a city in motion, and it offers valuable lessons for how we might plan our spaces in the years to come.
